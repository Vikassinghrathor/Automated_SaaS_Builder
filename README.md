## Favorite Project: SAAS Automation Builder



I’ve worked on is the SAAS Automation Builder , 

a robust B2C SaaS platform designed to streamline and automate various user workflows. Here are some key features and functionalities of the project:



Key Features



- Google Drive Integration: Users can connect their Google Drive to the app, allowing it to watch for changes and automatically trigger specific actions based on those changes.

- Slack Integration: Users can connect their Slack accounts to send notifications and custom messages directly to their Slack channels.

- Discord Integration: Similar to Slack, users can connect their Discord accounts to send notifications and custom messages to their Discord servers.

- Notion Integration: The platform can create entries in a Notion database, helping users organize and manage their information more effectively.

- Stripe Integration: The app uses Stripe to handle month-to-month subscription payments, with charges based on credits consumed by the user.

- Drag and Drop Node Builder: Users can create automation flows using a drag-and-drop interface, allowing them to build sequences of actions that fire after a trigger event occurs.

- Infinite Canvas and Mini Map: The interface features an infinite canvas for building workflows, along with a mini map to see all workflow nodes for easier navigation.

- Light & Dark Mode: The platform offers both light and dark modes to suit user preferences and enhance usability.

- Expandable Sidebar: The sidebar is expandable and features a drag functionality, providing users with more flexibility in navigating the interface.

- Beautiful Redesigned Node Interface: The nodes are designed with a beautiful and intuitive interface, making it easy for users to create and manage their workflows.

Additional Highlights
